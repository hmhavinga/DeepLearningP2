The word vectors can be downloaded at [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html), the file name is crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip.And the file TRAIN-balanced_trainset.csv can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rlRFfGI4ejgLLUBVoe2i0Z95wKvP4TCy). These files were too big to be included in this Github repository.

To be able to run the code all files should be unzipped and in the same folder.

Code.ipynb is the main code file, which is a jupyter notebook. This notebook can be run by the Jupyter Notebook app, to do so it is easiest to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
